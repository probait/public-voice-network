Humans don't give equal weight to the things they gain and the things the loose. We suffer from lose aversion, which causes us to asymmetrically focus on the negative.

AI will change many things and politicians usually represent vested interests that are negatively impacted by change (e.g. NIMBYs). 

We need AI realists in power, who are focused on competitiveness and ensuring everyone has access.
